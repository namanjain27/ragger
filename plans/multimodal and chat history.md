# goal
1. accept multi-modal input to be used as data source during retrieval.
Accepted files: pdf, ppt, images, docx, txt

2. store past chat data such that it can be used as knowledge base for future processing.
-> give appropriate label to each chat session for quick search and filter

## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES:

### 1. Enhanced File Processing Pipeline
- ✅ Add image OCR capabilities for extracted images from documents
  - Implemented Google Vision API and Tesseract OCR fallback
  - OCR text integrated into document content for better searchability
- ✅ Implement chunking strategies specific to document types (tables, headers, etc.)
  - Created SmartDocumentChunker with type-specific strategies
  - Preserves document structure (pages, slides, paragraphs) in metadata
- ✅ Add file validation and error handling
  - File type validation, size limits, and robust error handling
  - Universal extract_content() function for all supported file types
- [FUTURE] Support batch file uploads

### 2. Chat History Management
- ✅ Use conversation summarization for long sessions
  - Auto-generates conversation labels using LLM
  - Summarizes long conversations for storage efficiency
- ✅ Store chat history in separate collection in ChromaDB
  - Separate collections for documents and chat history
  - Session tracking with unique IDs and timestamps
  - Searchable conversation metadata

### 3. Multi-modal Integration
- ✅ Process images with vision models for better context
  - Integrated Gemini 2.5 vision capabilities
  - Analyzes standalone images and extracted document images
  - Detailed image descriptions for enhanced context
- [FUTURE] Extract and index tables, charts, and diagrams separately
- [FUTURE] Maintain document structure and relationships
