# Claude rules for customer success copilot app

## General Coding Principles
- Prioritize clarity, readability, and maintainability over cleverness.
- Use consistent naming conventions: `snake_case` for Python
- Keep functions short and modular. One function = one purpose.
- keep utility functions of a separate module in separate files with appropriate self-defining names
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or premature optimizations.
- Add comments explaining the WHY of the changes made wherever necessary
- give brief explaination of the changes made and the approach used after editing the code
- tell suggestion for next steps (especially comment if the application flow isn't complete yet)
